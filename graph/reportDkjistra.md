# Dijkstra algorithm applied on a directed graph

## Generalities
This exercises revolves around finding the shortest path from a specific location to the other 
ones listed in the dataset, for such purpose I organized the dataset into a graph and from there

## Some mentions to the Algorithm invention
Small fun fact

## Usage of Dijkstra
Common uses for Dijkstra

## Used data structures

Graph and it's complexities
Heap as a Priority Queue and it's complexities

## Full Description of dataset
